# CODE OF CONDUCT — ENGINEERING SUPREMACY

## 🎯 PURPOSE

This code of conduct enforces **engineering excellence**, not social niceties. It's designed to filter out mediocrity and attract serious contributors.

## ⚡ CORE PRINCIPLES

1. **Quality over politeness** — Harsh feedback is better than silent failure
2. **Merit over seniority** — Best solution wins, regardless of author
3. **Truth over comfort** — Uncomfortable truths are required
4. **Execution over discussion** — Code speaks louder than words
5. **Standards over exceptions** — No special treatment

## ✅ EXPECTED BEHAVIOR

- **Challenge assumptions** — Question everything, including your own code
- **Demand evidence** — "Trust me" is not an argument
- **Reject mediocrity** — Good enough is not good enough
- **Document failures** — Learn from mistakes, don't hide them
- **Enforce standards** — Hold yourself and others accountable

## ❌ PROHIBITED BEHAVIOR

- **Emotional arguments** — Feelings don't fix bugs
- **Appeal to authority** — "Senior said so" is not reasoning
- **Vague feedback** — "Looks good" is useless
- **Defensive responses** — Code reviews are not personal attacks
- **Lowering standards** — "It's just a small change" is not an excuse

## 🔨 ENFORCEMENT

Violations result in:

1. **First offense** — Warning + required education
2. **Second offense** — Temporary ban + mandatory review
3. **Third offense** — Permanent ban

## 📋 REVIEW STANDARDS

### Acceptable Feedback

- "This algorithm is O(n²), can we optimize?"
- "Missing error handling for edge case X"
- "Performance claim needs benchmark"
- "This abstraction adds complexity without benefit"

### Unacceptable Feedback

- "This is bad" (without explanation)
- "I don't like this" (without technical reason)
- "Change it because I said so" (without justification)

## 🎓 LEARNING VS EXCUSES

**Learning is encouraged:**
- Asking questions before coding
- Requesting code review guidance
- Studying existing patterns

**Excuses are not tolerated:**
- "I didn't know" (should have asked)
- "It works on my machine" (not production-ready)
- "I'll fix it later" (later is never)

## 🚨 ZERO TOLERANCE

**Immediate ban for:**
- Submitting malicious code
- Intentionally breaking builds
- Harassing contributors
- Violating security practices

## 📊 QUALITY METRICS

Your contributions are measured by:

- **Code quality** — Tests, coverage, benchmarks
- **Documentation** — Clarity, completeness
- **Impact** — Measurable improvements
- **Reliability** — Failure mode handling

## 🎯 FINAL WORD

**This is not a safe space.**  
**This is a high-performance engineering environment.**

If you can't handle:
- Direct feedback
- High standards
- Technical criticism
- Failure analysis

**Don't contribute.**

---

**Excellence is the only acceptable standard.**
